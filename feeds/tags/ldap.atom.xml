Server Admin were showing up as stale links in my clients. Though not
deal breaking, it was annoying as it indicating some sort of corruption
in my ldap configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After digging around, I found that the records still existed in my
server's LDAP under /Mounts. Including a duplicate entry for my
/Network/Applications entry. By removing these and reloading the clients
automount (sudo automount), everything went back to normal.&lt;/p&gt;
